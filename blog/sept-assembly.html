    <h1>assembly (9/26/2022)</h1>
    <p>our school had an assembly about this thing called "step it up" which was this fundraiser type thing which included prizes.</p>
    <p>except, it wasn't this normal fundraiser, there was this "golden ticket" which contained stuff.</p>
    <p>here, let me read it to you.</p>
    <h2 style="font-family:arial;">three ways to earn prizes</h2>
    <h3 style="font-family:arial;">number 1</h3>
    <p style="font-family:arial;">e-mail or contact 10 of your friends/family to let them know about it by tonight</p>
    <p style="font-family:arial;">prizes include: super fly monkey, cosmic beat bar, the retractor triple charge</p>
    <h3 style="font-family:arial;">number 2</h3>
    <p style="font-family:arial;">share with 10 contacts and you're entered to <b>win a $250 amazon gift card</b></p>
    <p style="font-family:arial;">share with 20 contacts for a chance to <b>win one of four mini fridges stuffed with cash</b></p>
    <h3 style="font-family:arial;">number 3</h3>
    <h3 style="font-family:arial;">get more donations, earn more prizes</h3>
    <h4 style="font-family:arial;">level 1</h4>
    <p style="font-family:arial;"><b>enjoy the day of awesomeness and dj dange party</b></p>
    <h4 style="font-family:arial;">level 2</h4>
    <p style="font-family:arial;">collect $150 in donations and add <b>a spin on the money wheel</b></p>
    <h4 style="font-family:arial;">level 3</h4>
    <p style="font-family:arial;">collect $250 in donations and add the <b>burrito blanket</b></p>
    <h4 style="font-family:arial;">level 4</h4>
    <p><span style="font-family:arial;">collect $350 in donations and add <b>the elephant earbud</b></span> (which is a giant airpod kind of?)</p>
    <p style="font-family:arial;">collect $500 in donations and add a <b>jump into the cash bonanza</b></p>
    <p style="font-family:arial;">collecting $600 or more would be earning an amazon gift card to shop</p>
    <small style="font-family:arial;">$600=$25 gift - $750=$50 gift - $1k=$100 gift - $1.5k=$200 gift - $2k=$300 gift - $2.5k=$400 gift</small>
    <p>if you couldn't tell already, it seems kind of <span title="shut the fuck up">suspicious</span></p>
    <p>i mean, bribing kids with prizes for money HAS to be a crime.</p>
    <p>i know THEY aren't getting the money, but schools hire this thing to get money for themselves. they are literally hiring someone else to bribe</p>
    <p>and, it was clear the prizes were sponsored, like all of the prizes had their own videos, all of which seemed like some youtube ad you'd get.</p>
    <p>and the worst part was, the students were EXCITED for this.</p>
    <p>i tried talking some sense into the person next to me, and it worked.</p>
    <p>so now we are the only two protesting against this.</p>
    <p>i brought this paper home to my grandma (shes the only one i live with besides my uncle (who isn't a legal guardian)), and she felt the same way.</p>
    <p>i didn't even mention it, she just looked at the paper and knew.</p>
    <p>i was happy, but the day of awesomeness actually looks fun...</p>
    <p>this just makes me think of the other kids who had their parents say the same.</p>
    <p>they probably FLIPPED.</p>
    <p>anyway i guess thats the end for now.</p>

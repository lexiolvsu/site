    <h1>tablet (10/1/22)</h1>
    <p>hello to all of the people on my site somehow.</p>
    <p>my site is at 578 views right now, which is surprising because i have NOT shared this site anywhere.</p>
    <p>the stats are <a title="Warning: You are leaving the page. Snapshots were blocked on this web site." href="https://neocities.org/site/lexio/stats">here</a> but im pretty sure the visits are from the leftover "lore" tag from when this website was just a lore drop about my oc (forgor to change).</p>
    <p>i replaced the tags with new ones but it's just blog, the name of my channel, and my site.</p>
    <p>i also updated the site with sum stuff.</p>
    <p>anyway, i really wanted to draw <a href="https://lexio.neocities.org/hyperlinks/districts/images/concept.png">pippin</a> who is the districts mascot but my mouse drawing skills suck ass.</p>
    <p>my paper drawing skills are better, and thats why i bought a tablet (huion h420) 3 years ago. that one broke so i bought another one (cth-480) a year later.</p>
    <p>before you say anything, no i didn't buy them for osu. i know the cth-480 is "the best tablet for osu" or some shit like that, but i bought it because it just appeared in my shopping feed one day.</p>
    <p>i lost the cable and pen to the tablet, so i looked for them as hard as i could, and guess fucking what.</p>
    <p>i found the pen.</p>
    <p>but... the cable on the other hand... </p><h3>fucking</h3><h1>no</h1>.<p></p>
    <p>i found a cable in my drawer, but it didn't work.</p>
    <p>apparently the cable is weak as fuck and cant handle a graphics tablet, so i looked upstairs for it.</p>
    <p>i found a cable, but the handle's wires were exposed and thats dangerous (or not idk if the handles count)</p>
    <p>so i found a blue one but it's usb-c</p>
    <p>its like we ONLY have usb-c, my grandma has a pixel 1 (fucking weak lmao (i say as i dont even have a fucking phone)) and thats usb-c so we only have usb-c for no damn reason!</p>
    <p>i was getting really fucking desperate at this point so i just used my leapster connector (i found my old leapster from my childhood, still havent charged it)</p>
    <p>but guess what? its a different fucking cable!</p>
    <p>i then realized my microphone has mini usb just like it.</p>
    <p>if it can handle a microphone, it can handle a drawing tablet</p>
    <p>but guess fucking  what</p>
    <p>i have a razer seiren mini and the cable is like <a href="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/yccAAOSwgDdiu-zw/s-l1600.jpg">this</a> so it wouldnt look ridiculous but thanks to that... IT DIDNT WORK</p>
    <p>i found one under my bed, still didn't fucking work.</p>
    <p>im out of options, <a title="Warning: You are leaving the page. Snapshots were blocked on this web site." href="https://neocities.org/site/lexio?event_id=2253552">please comment on my thread about this</a> whether i should use this fucking cable or not (no guestbook because my internet is having a fucking stroke and wont load sites that include communication)</p>
